## Architecture üìê
Project is a MVP (Model View Presenter ) architecture pattern.


* MVP's goal is moving the Controller out of the Activity into its own class so that the Controller can be unit testable is MVP, and is consists of these parts: 

* Model consists of the data objects.

* View displays the UI and listens to user actions.This is typically an Activity (or Fragment). 

* Presenter is the glue class that talks to both the Model and View. Any code that does not directly handle UI should be moved out of the View and into the Presenter class.
