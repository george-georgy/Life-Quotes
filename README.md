This sample is written in MVC for Life Quotes app.


## Architecture üìê
Project is a MVC (Model View Controller) architecture pattern.


* In MVC, the main entry point to the app is through the Controller, so it makes sense to give the role of the Controller to the Activity where it can take in user inputs,such as a button click, and respond accordingly.

* Model consists of the data objects.

* The View consists of the layout files in an Android app.
